A simple website that was made with bootstrap 5, mobile-friendly and optimize for accesibility. Inspired by a course at [Tree House](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/bootstrap-basics).

## API calls
We use the random data API to generate the "Presentors" information so things like the name, title and avatar.

## What I learned?

While doing this project i learn a lot more about making sure the website is accessible for everyone. I learn how screen readers work and i made some simple api calls with vanilla JS and Axios.
